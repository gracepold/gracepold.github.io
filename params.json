In a previous (pre-grad school) life, I studied everything from plant-insect interactions to toad population dynamics, but now I am trying to figure out whether the way microbes respond to climate change affects how they process soil organic matter. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Previous research:\r\n\r\n###How will climate change affect the Northeastern United States?\r\n\r\nPrior to starting grad school, I did an REU and then worked as a research assistant at the Boston Area Climate Experiment run by [Jeff Dukes](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/lab/index.html). The [Boston Area Climate Experiment](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/bace.html) (BACE) is set up to mimic a variety of possible climate scenarios which may exist in the Northeastern United States 100 years from now, including four levels of warming and three levels of precipitation. My REU project was designed to look at how climate change will affect how susceptible plants are to herbivory, but as it was an exceptionally hot and dry year it primarily ended up being an intensive study on the [slow death of seedlings](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2011/webprogram/Paper27491.html). As a research assistant I spent the best part of six months helping to disassemble and rebuild two of the greenhouse structures after they collapsed in a heavy snowfall. Between the drought and the heavy snowfall, a lot of the trees were dead by spring, so I harvested the trees and tried to develop allometric equations to predict tree weight from height and stem diameter. If you ever try this, it doesn't really work well if you have trees which have been half gnawed off by hungry meadow voles which have subsequently gone and died in the soil moisture cable storage box. To learn more about some of the cool work going on at the BACE before, during, and after my time there, click [here](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/lab/publications.html). \r\n\r\n![That's me in the background trying to fix a Li-Cor to determine how climate affects parameters of tree photosynthesis.](https://climatesummer.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_0231.jpg)\r\n\r\n###How are humans impacting amphibian populations?\r\n\r\nAfter I finished my undergrad I spent a month on Long Point, Ontario helping capture and measure Fowlers toads for a long-term population study led by [David Green](http://redpath-staff.mcgill.ca/green/) of McGill. Fowlers toads are only really found in areas with freshwater dunes, as this is where they hibernate. Since people also like having houses on the beach, this makes for some human vs. toad conflict. Long Point is the northern edge of the current range of these toads, and while they are relatively abundant in Indiana, for example, they are extremely rare in the southern portions of Canada. The study I was assisting on had tracked the demise of these toads for 20 years, starting when Long Point was a mostly undeveloped strip of land and continuing to the modern day when a wildlife ecologist is paid full-time by the Ontario government to walk along a 1-mile strip of road and count fresh roadkill. \r\n\r\n\r\n###How can we manage invasive species?\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I got my start in research as a field assistant looking at whether sheep were more effective at removing invasive plant species from meadows than mowing is. As in many places, invasive plant species such as multiflora rose, purple loostrife, and barberry had taken over the native species in the meadows/swamps, meaning native birds and insects also lost their homes and food sources. Since this study was taking place at [Minute Man National Historic Park](https://www.nps.gov/mima/index.htm), the key incentive was to return the landscape to look like colonial times. So while goats may be more effective than sheep at grazing on invasive species due to their high tolerance for toxic compounds and ability to reach tall branches, sheep were used because they are part of the historic landscape and so were already present at the park. Unfortunately the ground was too wet to mow and the sheep farmer changed his mind about putting the sheep on the land, so implementing the experimental treatments didn't exactly happen. However, I did get to spend a lot of time in the field being watched over by a man playing the fife while dressed in colonial attire. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Present research:\r\n\r\n####Can we infer physiological response to climate stressors based on genomic sequence?\r\n\r\n\r\n####Can readily-collected data on soil bacterial isolates be meaningfully incorporated into models of the soil carbon cycle?\r\n\r\n\r\n####How will climate change affect how soil carbon is processed?\r\n\r\n\r\n####How does long-term warming affect microbial communities?\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\n\r\nComments or questions - feel free to contact me at apold at umass dot edu",
